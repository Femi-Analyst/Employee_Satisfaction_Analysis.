## Objectives

## Key Findings
**Workplace Relationships:** Question 6 ("I have a best friend at work") scored lowest across all roles and departments.  
**Role Differences:** Supervisors and leadership roles rate engagement higher than Staff.  
**Department Differences:** Family Justice Center and Emergency Management scored highest; Sheriff’s Department scored lowest.  
**Recognition and Growth:** Staff report low recognition (Q3) and limited growth opportunities (Q7).
